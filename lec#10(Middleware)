Middleware:


Middleware:
Types of Middleware:
1. Request-Editing Middleware: Modifies the incoming request.
2. Response-Editing Middleware: Modifies the outgoing response.
3. Short-Circuiting Middleware: Stops the request pipeline and sends a response.
4. Content-Generating Middleware: Creates content or output. 

Important points related to middleware:
- Has access to both Request and Response
- May simple pass the Request to next Middleware
- May process and then pass the Request to next Middleware
- May handle the Request and short-circuit the pipline
- May Process the outgoing Respnse 
- Middlewares are exec  uted in the order they are added


What is extenions methods?
Use(), Run(), UseRouting(), these are the extensions method.
What is the Difference Between MapGet and Map Extension Methods in ASP.NET Core?

MapGet Method:
- to handle HTTP GET requests. It’s used to define endpoints that respond only to GET requests.
- to retrieve data from the server without modifying its state, such as fetching a list of items or getting details about a specific item.
- takes a route pattern and a request delegate (a handler function). The handler function is executed when a GET request matches the specified route pattern.

Map Method:
- for handling all types of HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). It’s more flexible than MapGet.
- We need to use Map when we need to set up endpoints that might handle multiple types of HTTP requests or 
when we have custom logic to determine the type of request to be handled.
- Like MapGet, Map also takes a route pattern and a request delegate. 
However, since Map can handle various HTTP methods, the request delegate often contains 
logic to differentiate between these methods.
